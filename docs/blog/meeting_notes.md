# üìù Meeting Notes

**Date:** May 22nd, 2025  
**Attendees:** Alex, Emma, Sam

---

## Alex
- Added a new page to the blog with his notes.

---

## Emma
- Is cool.
- Emma uses Claude, not so much ChatGPT, for all her AI needs.

---

## Sam
- Talked about why we use the `uv` package manager.
- Using Whispr Flow ‚Äî it's a fancy AI-powered voice-to-text tool that does a really good job.
- Figuring out how to embed Google Docs into MkDocs.
- Taught someone else to use MkDocs. Wondering if there‚Äôs a way to have a lot of documentation in MkDocs and also have a bot that lives in there.
- Realized that her staff might not be comfortable using MkDocs in a code interface. If they just use Google Docs, there needs to be a way to pipeline it.
- Asked: How does versioning work in Google Docs?
    - You can convert Google Docs to PDF ‚Äî Docling works a lot better with that!
    - If it‚Äôs a PDF, the OCR part of Docling recognizes it much better. Docling can recognize things like bolded text.
- Sam's big question: How do we create a system that no-code people can understand and handle?
- Been taking a prompt engineering workshop ‚Äî prompt engineering is important!
- Showed us the new drive she is working on for her fab.
- Versioning in Google Docs:
    - You can see and name version histories.
    - Making a changelog for each SOP folder.
    - In the changelog, you can also append the URL so that it adds the extension and exports as a PDF.
    - Google Docs has two export functions: one for PDFs, one for the native format (e.g., `.docx`, `.xlsx`).
    - In Google, as long as you have the URL, the document ID stays the same ‚Äî the file structure is just for humans. *Mind blown.*
- Alex says: ‚ÄúBefore we ask more from our data, we must ask more from ourselves.‚Äù
- Getting community engagement is key!
    - What kind of pizza do you like, and how do you want to communicate with others?
    - Highest responses were: Gen AI, Stack Exchange, Discord ‚Äî *anything but a chatbot lol*.
- Idea: Having a forum where lab members can discuss stuff ‚Äî and we scrape the hell out of it.
- The Matplotlib community is on Discord.
    - You need volunteers in the community that answer questions very well ‚Äî this keeps the inertia going.
- Suggestion: Having a ‚ÄúStars of‚Äù badge system ‚Äî track who‚Äôs contributing and who has good contributions.
- Dennis from UCSB reached out with interest about the project.

## For Next Time
- Investigate options for forum or community Q&A integration (e.g., Discord or Stack Exchange-style forum).
- Review Docling‚Äôs strengths with OCR and PDF exports ‚Äî can we optimize the export flow?
